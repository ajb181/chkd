## COMPLETED: DB-First Migration (2026-01-27)

**Epic complete.** Database is now sole source of truth for spec items.

**What changed:**
- MCP server uses HTTP API (no parser)
- All API endpoints query DB directly
- Parser isolated to maintenance tools only

**Test with:** See `docs/HANDOVER-db-first-complete.md` for full testing guide.

**Quick smoke test:**
```bash
npm run dev  # port 3847
# Then in Claude:
> chkd status
> chkd add "Test" --area SD
> chkd tick "Test"
```
