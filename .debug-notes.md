## Debug Session: 2026-01-20 21:34
**Bug:** Awaiting user clarification

### Findings
- `chkd fix` command already existed in CLI (line 239-280)
- API endpoint PATCH /api/bugs already existed  
- Database functions getBugByQuery/updateBugStatus already existed
- Command was just missing from user awareness

### Verified
- [x] `chkd fix "Test bug"` - worked
- [x] `chkd fix "Phase emoji"` - worked
- [x] `chkd bugs --all` shows both as fixed

No code changes needed - feature was already implemented.

**Bug:** Terminal not connecting + sizing issues (horizontal/vertical scrollbars appearing)

### Symptoms
1. Terminal shows "Disconnected" and "Connecting to terminal..." forever
2. Small horizontal and vertical scrollbars appearing in terminal panel
3. Text "Connecting to terminal" also appears at bottom of screen (cropped/leaked)

### Research

### Findings
**Connection Issue:**
- Server running `vite dev` directly (npm run dev:vite)
- Should run `node dev-server.js` (npm run dev) for WebSocket support
- FIX: Restart server with correct command

**Sizing Issue:**
- .terminal-body has padding: 8px reducing space
- xterm-viewport set to overflow-y: auto showing scrollbar
- xterm may be rendering slightly larger than container

### Fix Applied

- Fixed spawn-helper missing execute permission (chmod +x)
- Fixed double keypress by closing old connections to same session
- Added scroll handler to only capture scroll when focused/hovered

### Status
Connection bug FIXED - terminal connects now.
Sizing/overflow bug PARTIALLY FIXED - still some issues with tmux status bar.

### Verified
- [x] Terminal connects (shows "Connected")
- [x] spawn-helper permissions fixed
- [x] Double keypress fixed
- [ ] Overflow fully contained (tmux bar still leaks slightly)

### Final Fixes Applied
- spawn-helper chmod +x (node-pty permission issue)
- Close old connections to prevent double input
- Removed `contain: strict` CSS (was blocking input textarea)
- Enabled xterm-helper-textarea explicitly
- Added restart button to terminal
- tmux `set mouse on` for scroll support

### Verified Working
- [x] Terminal connects
- [x] Keyboard input works
- [x] Mouse scroll works
- [x] Restart button added

### Remaining Minor Issues
- Text rendering occasionally incomplete
- Tmux status bar overflow (cosmetic)

## Status: FIXED (core functionality working, cosmetic overflow deferred)

## Session Closed: 2026-01-21
User decided to move on. Terminal is functional - connection, input, and scroll all work. Cosmetic overflow issue remains but not blocking.
