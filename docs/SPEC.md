# chkd v2 Specification

> Organized by **system area** rather than build phase.
> The spec is both the todo list and the map of what exists.

<!-- ⚠️ CLAUDE: Do NOT edit this file directly! Use chkd CLI commands:
     - chkd add "feature" - Add new items
     - chkd tick "item"   - Mark items complete
     - chkd working "item" - Mark items in-progress
     This keeps the UI in sync and tracks changes properly. -->

## Overview

**chkd** is a development workflow system that makes AI-assisted development structured and consistent.

**Core idea**: Plan in one place (UI), build in another (terminal). The spec is the source of truth.

  - [ ] PATCH /api/workers/:id - Update status/heartbeat
  - [ ] DELETE /api/workers/:id - Stop worker, cleanup
  - [ ] POST /api/workers/:id/merge - Merge worker's branch

### Phase 2: One-Click Spawning
- [ ] **MW.4 Worker MCP Tools** - Master Claude spawns and manages workers
  - [ ] chkd_spawn_worker(taskId) - Create worktree + spawn worker
  - [ ] chkd_workers() - List active workers
  - [ ] chkd_pause_worker(id) / chkd_resume_worker(id)
  - [ ] chkd_merge_worker(id, strategy)

- [ ] **MW.5 Worker Heartbeat System** - Workers report status
  - [ ] chkd_worker_heartbeat(message) - Worker pings every 30s
  - [ ] chkd_worker_complete() - Worker signals done
  - [ ] Dead worker detection (no heartbeat > 2min)

- [ ] **MW.6 Enhanced Repo Card UI** - Show workers at high level
  - [ ] Taller repo card with worker summary strip
  - [ ] Worker status indicators (🟢 working, 🟡 merging, ⚠️ conflict)
  - [ ] Manager signal preview in card
  - [ ] "Spawn Worker" button

### Phase 3: Split Brain View & Auto-Merge
- [ ] **MW.7 Split Brain View** - Side-by-side worker panels
  - [ ] Current task + progress per worker
  - [ ] Next in queue display
  - [ ] Recently touched files list
  - [ ] Pause/Stop/View Code actions

- [ ] **MW.8 Manager Signal Bar** - Coordinator communication
  - [ ] Status updates ("Both workers on track...")
  - [ ] Decision notifications ("✅ Merged SD.3!")
  - [ ] Help requests ("⚠️ Conflict in App.svelte")
  - [ ] Suggestions ("💡 Spawn W2 for SD.4?")

- [ ] **MW.9 Auto-Merge System** - Merge when safe, ask when not
  - [ ] Pre-merge conflict check
  - [ ] Auto-merge if clean
  - [ ] Conflict resolution UI (keep mine/theirs/both)
  - [ ] Worktree cleanup after merge

### Phase 4: Manager as Tech Lead
- [ ] **MW.10 Manager Research Mode** - Explore codebase before assigning work
  - [ ] Codebase exploration tools for Manager
  - [ ] Pattern detection (find existing auth, DB patterns, etc.)
  - [ ] Dependency analysis (what does this touch?)
  - [ ] Research summary for user approval

- [ ] **MW.11 Manager Story Writer** - Create detailed specs from user requests
  - [ ] Parse user request into structured story
  - [ ] Generate acceptance criteria
  - [ ] Break into worker-assignable sub-tasks
  - [ ] Estimate complexity/dependencies
  - [ ] Present story for user approval before spawning

- [ ] **MW.12 Manager Code Review** - Review worker output before merge
  - [ ] Pull and diff worker branch
  - [ ] Check code quality (patterns, style, tests)
  - [ ] Verify acceptance criteria met
  - [ ] Send feedback to worker if issues
  - [ ] Approve for merge when satisfied

- [ ] **MW.13 Manager Documenter** - Update docs after work completes
  - [ ] Update README with new features
  - [ ] Add entry to CHANGELOG
  - [ ] Update API docs if endpoints changed
  - [ ] Update inline code comments if needed
  - [ ] Commit docs update with merge

### Phase 5: External Collaboration
- [ ] **MW.14 External Story Submission** - Allow non-developers to submit feature ideas
  - [ ] Public-facing form to submit story/feature idea
  - [ ] Story lands in "Ideas" queue (not spec yet)
  - [ ] Manager reviews and refines submissions
  - [ ] Approve to promote to spec, or reject with feedback
  - [ ] Email notification when idea is accepted/rejected
  - [ ] Simple auth (email link or code) for submitters to track their ideas

> As a stakeholder/user, I want to submit feature ideas without needing to edit the spec directly, so that I can contribute ideas even if I'm not a developer.

### Future: SaaS Platform
- [ ] **MW.15 SaaS Architecture** - Design for hosted multi-tenant platform
  - [ ] PostgreSQL migration path from SQLite
  - [ ] Multi-tenant data isolation
  - [ ] Team workspaces with roles (admin, dev, viewer)
  - [ ] GitHub/GitLab app integration
  - [ ] Managed Claude workers (cloud-hosted)
  - [ ] Usage-based billing infrastructure
  - [ ] Analytics dashboard (velocity, time tracking)

> As a team, we want a hosted chkd service so we don't need to run infrastructure ourselves.

## Future Areas

> Not yet started. Organized by what they'll touch.

### Quality Features (v3+)
- [ ] **FUT.1 Test Generation** - Auto-generate tests on commit (port from v1)
- [ ] **FUT.2 Sceptic Check** - Validate ideas before building
- [ ] **FUT.3 Quality Gates** - Block bad code from main
- [ ] **FUT.4 Code Health Checks** - Simple quality checks before/after tasks using jscpd (duplication) and knip (dead code). Integrate into Explore phase - flag issues, let user decide to refactor or proceed. Not a gate, just information.

> As a developer, I want code health checks before starting a task so I can decide whether to refactor first, and after finishing so I can log any new technical debt.
  - [ ] Explore: research problem, check existing code/patterns
  - [ ] Design: plan approach + define endpoint contracts
  - [ ] Prototype: build UI with mock data, stub backend
  - [ ] Feedback: user reviews and approves UX
  - [ ] Implement: connect real backend logic
  - [ ] Polish: error states, edge cases, performance

### Git & Source Control (UI owns this)
- [ ] **FUT.4 Diff View** - See what changed during session
- [ ] **FUT.5 Staging UI** - Select files to commit
- [ ] **FUT.6 Commit Flow** - Pre-fill message from session, commit
- [ ] **FUT.7 Push to Remote** - Push when ready
- [ ] **FUT.8 Audit Trail** - History of commits per session

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **FUT.9 WebSocket Updates** - Real-time UI updates
- [ ] **FUT.10 Version History** - Track spec changes over time
- [ ] **FUT.11 Create the best debug workflow and tool in the MCP ever created** - Create comprehensive debugging capabilities and workflow tools that surpass existing MCP debugging solutions.

> As a developer, I want powerful debug tools and workflows so that I can efficiently troubleshoot and resolve issues in the MCP system.
  - [ ] Explore: research existing MCP debug tools & pain points
  - [ ] Explore: audit current logging/error handling capabilities
  - [ ] Design: debug workflow + tool architecture/contracts
  - [ ] Prototype: core debug tools with mock error scenarios
  - [ ] Get feedback: test debug workflow with real issues
  - [ ] Implement: full debug toolset with enhanced logging
  - [ ] Polish: refine tools based on usage patterns
  - [ ] Document: debug workflow guide & tool reference
