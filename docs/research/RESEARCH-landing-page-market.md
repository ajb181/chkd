# Landing Page & Market Research

Research conducted: January 2026

## Executive Summary

chkd occupies a unique position in the AI coding tools market. It's not competing with Cursor, Claude Code, or Copilot directly - those are the **engines**. chkd is the **methodology layer** - a structured workflow framework that makes AI coding more effective.

**Key Insight:** The market is flooded with AI coding tools but lacks structured methodologies. chkd fills this gap.

#### Major Players (AI Coding Engines)

| Tool | Type | Pricing | Market Position |
|------|------|---------|-----------------|
| **GitHub Copilot** | IDE Integration | $0-39/mo | Dominant by presence, Microsoft ecosystem |
| **Cursor** | AI-First IDE | $0-20/mo | Fastest growing SaaS ever ($500M ARR in 12 months) |
| **Claude Code** | Terminal Agent | ~$20/mo (via Claude Pro) | Production-ready code, 30% less rework |
| **Windsurf** | IDE + Agents | Varies | Complex multi-step tasks (Cascade feature) |
| **OpenAI Codex** | Terminal Agent | Varies | Re-emerged as serious agent-first tool |

#### Key Market Stats
- 85% of developers use at least one AI tool (2025 Pragmatic Engineer survey)
- Claude Code uses 5.5x fewer tokens than Cursor for same tasks
- "Agentic" was the word of the year for 2025
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) became as common as running a web server

### Where chkd Fits

**chkd is NOT competing with these tools. It works WITH them.**

The market has:
- **Engines** (Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot) - write and generate code
- **Platforms** (Bolt.new, Lovable) - full-stack browser environments
- **Workflow Automation** (n8n) - connecting services

**What's missing:** A lightweight methodology that keeps humans engaged and AI focused.

## Part 2: The Methodology Gap

### Existing Workflow Approaches

Sources: [Builder.io](https://www.builder.io/blog/claude-code), [Developer Toolkit](https://developertoolkit.ai/en/shared-workflows/best-practices/), [Softcery](https://softcery.com/lab/softcerys-guide-agentic-coding-best-practices)

#### Current Best Practices (Manual)

Most guides recommend:
1. **Plan, Execute, Verify** - three-phase structured approach
2. **CLAUDE.md files** - persistent project knowledge
3. **memory.md / plan.md** - tracking state
4. **Cold-start on failure** - don't patch, restart fresh

**The Problem:** These are manual, scattered, and require discipline to maintain.

#### Existing Frameworks

| Framework | Approach | Problem |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **BMAD Method** | 12+ specialized agents (PM, Architect, Dev, UX, etc.) | Too heavy, enterprise complexity |
| **Manual .cursorrules** | Context files per project | Requires setup each time, no tracking |
| **Ad-hoc prompting** | No structure | Context lost, builds wrong things |

### chkd's Opportunity

**The gap:** Lightweight structure that doesn't slow you down but keeps you engaged.

| Approach | Speed | Structure | Human Engagement |
|----------|-------|-----------|------------------|
| Raw AI (no framework) | Fast | None | Low (watching) |
| Heavy methodology (BMAD) | Slow | High | Bureaucratic |
| **chkd** | Fast | Light | High (thinking) |

## Part 3: Landing Page Best Practices

### General SaaS Landing Page Principles

Sources: [Magic UI](https://magicui.design/blog/saas-landing-page-best-practices), [Unbounce](https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/the-state-of-saas-landing-pages/), [Userpilot](https://userpilot.com/blog/saas-landing-page-best-practices/)

#### Core Elements That Convert

1. **Single Goal Focus** - One CTA, one purpose. Decision fatigue kills conversion.
2. **First 5 Seconds Matter** - Clunky/outdated design = immediate bounce
3. **Clarity Over Cleverness** - What is it? Who is it for? Why should I care?
4. **Social Proof** - Trust signals, testimonials, logos
5. **Interactive Demos** - "Show, don't tell" - buyers want to try first
6. **Mobile Optimization** - Majority visit on phones

#### Hero Section Best Practices

Sources: [Prismic](https://prismic.io/blog/website-hero-section), [LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/hero-section-examples-best-practices/), [Landing Rabbit](https://landingrabbit.com/blog/saas-website-hero-section)

**Must Answer:**
- **What** is this?
- **Who** is it for?
- **Why** should I care?

**Copy Principles:**
- Lead with specific promise/outcome, not vague taglines
- Short copy works when context is clear
- Action-oriented CTAs ("Start Building" not "Submit")
- Supportive microcopy reduces friction ("No credit card required")

**Developer-Specific:**
- Secondary CTA to docs is smart (Stripe does this)
- Show you understand the ICP (ideal customer profile)
- Technical credibility matters

## Part 4: The "Linear Style" Design Trend

Sources: [Medium/Design Bootcamp](https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/the-rise-of-linear-style-design-origins-trends-and-techniques-4fd96aab7646), [LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/linear-design/), [Eleken](https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/linear-app-case-study)

### Why Linear's Design Dominates Developer Tools

Linear became a $400M issue tracker by obsessing over:
- **Speed** - high-performance architecture
- **Focus** - clean, clutter-free UI
- **Developer-first UX** - keyboard navigation, dark mode

### Linear Style Characteristics

| Element | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Dark backgrounds** | Based on coding environments, reduces eye strain |
| **Gradient colors** | Subtle, purposeful accents |
| **Bold typography** | Inter font, high contrast |
| **Glassmorphism** | Blur effects, depth |
| **Minimal clutter** | No busy sidebars, popups, tabs |
| **Micro-animations** | Purposeful motion, not decorative |

### Why It Works

- **Performant** - simplicity = fewer bugs, faster load
- **Accessible** - clean, high-contrast, easy to use
- **Professional** - looks "engineered" to developers
- **Reduced decision fatigue** - opinionated workflows

### Linear's Cultural Stance

Linear opposes Silicon Valley's "fail fast" A/B testing culture. Instead:
- **Craft over metrics** - taste matters
- **Empowered individuals** - not rigid teams
- **Flexible goals** - not KPI obsession

**Lesson for chkd:** Great design + focus + disciplined execution = growth strategy itself.

## Part 5: chkd Positioning Strategy

### What chkd Actually Is

**A lightweight methodology for AI-assisted development.**

It's NOT:
- An AI coding tool (that's Cursor/Claude Code)
- A project management system (that's Linear/Jira)
- A heavy enterprise framework (that's BMAD)

It IS:
- A thinking framework that keeps you engaged
- A simple structure (6 commands) that tracks what you're building
- A way to not lose context between sessions
- Epic → Story → Task breakdown with verification at each step

### Target Audience

**"People in between"**
- Not hardcore terminal developers
- Not complete non-coders
- Building products, startups, side projects
- Comfortable with tech, learning AI tools
- Want best practices without overhead

### Key Differentiators

| Competitor Approach | chkd Approach |
|---------------------|---------------|
| No structure (raw AI) | Lightweight structure |
| Heavy process (BMAD) | 6 simple commands |
| Context constantly lost | Pick up where you left off |
| AI runs ahead | Human verifies each step |
| Build wrong things | Declare → Build → Verify cycle |

### Value Proposition

**Core message:** "Better thinking in, better building out."

The framework helps you:
1. **Clarify** what you actually want (declare)
2. **Stay engaged** as AI builds (don't just watch)
3. **Verify** at each checkpoint (epics, stories, tasks)
4. **Never lose context** (session continuity)

---

## Part 6: Landing Page Recommendations

### Hero Section

**Don't:** Be salesy with buzzwords
**Do:** Explain what it is clearly

**Recommended Approach:**
```
Headline: A methodology for building with AI
Subhead: Six commands. Epic → Story → Task. You think, AI builds, together you ship.
```

### Structure

1. **Hero** - What is it, who is it for
2. **The Problem** - Raw AI loses context, builds wrong things
3. **The Solution** - The declare → build → verify cycle
4. **How It Works** - Epic → Story → Task breakdown
5. **The Commands** - Six simple commands (not decorative, functional)
6. **Why It Matters** - Human stays engaged, nothing lost
7. **CTA** - Get started

### Design Direction

Based on Linear style research:
- Dark background (developer-friendly)
- Clean typography (Inter or Space Mono)
- Minimal animation (purposeful, not decorative)
- High contrast, accessibility-first
- Show the product, not abstract graphics

### Copy Tone

- **Explanatory** not salesy
- **Confident** not hype-y
- **Specific** not vague
- **Developer-respectful** not dumbed-down

## Part 7: Feature Highlights

### Epic & Story System

chkd isn't just commands - it's a full planning workflow:

```
Epic (big feature)
  └── Story (user-facing slice)
        └── Task (implementation step)
              └── Sub-task (atomic action)
```

Each level has:
- Clear definition
- Verification checkpoint
- Progress tracking

### What to Emphasize

1. **Epics** - Plan big features before diving in
2. **Stories** - Break into user-facing slices
3. **Tasks** - Track implementation steps
4. **The Cycle** - Declare → Build → Verify → Repeat
5. **Session Continuity** - Pick up where you left off
6. **Bug Tracking** - Log issues without derailing
