# chkd Positioning

## The Core Insight

From research document "The Problem":

> The friction between idea → creation has collapsed.
> What hasn't collapsed is the cost of confusion, dilution, and regret.
> The bottleneck has moved from **execution** → **discernment**.

And:

> If everything is easy to build, **clarity becomes the only moat**.

## What We Are (One Sentence)

**chkd is a lightweight methodology that keeps you thinking while AI builds.**

That's it. Not a coding tool. Not a project manager. A methodology.

---

## The Specialist Positioning

Products that feel like **specialists**:
- Calm
- Opinionated
- Slightly restrictive (in a good way)
- Easy to explain in one sentence
- Fast to adopt
- Emotionally *safe*

Products that feel like **generalists**:
- Powerful but harder to explain
- Flexible but slower to trust
- Slightly anxious to use

**chkd must feel like a specialist.**

One problem. One solution. Clear boundaries.

---

## What We Are

- A **methodology** for AI-assisted development
- A **thinking framework** that keeps you engaged
- A **spec-based workflow** (Epic → Story → Task)
- A **session tracker** so nothing gets lost
- **Lightweight** — six commands, one cycle
- **Opinionated** — there's a right way to do this

## What We Are NOT

- Not an AI coding tool (that's Cursor, Claude Code)
- Not a project management system (that's Linear, Jira)
- Not a heavy enterprise framework (that's BMAD)
- Not trying to "control" or "slow down" AI
- Not for everyone

## Who This Is For

### Primary: The "In-Between" Builder

People who are:
- Building products, startups, side projects
- Comfortable with tech, learning AI tools
- Not hardcore terminal developers
- Not complete non-coders
- Want best practices without overhead
- Feel slightly anxious when AI runs ahead

**The feeling we solve:** "AI is building things but I've lost track of what it's doing and why."

### User Stories

#### 1. The Side Project Builder
**Sarah, Product Designer learning to code**

"I use Claude Code to build my side project. It's amazing but chaotic. I'd start a session, ask for a feature, get distracted by bugs, fix those, forget what I was doing. Next day I'd open the project and have no idea where I left off.

With chkd I declare what I'm building before I start. When bugs come up, I log them and keep going. When I come back tomorrow, I know exactly what's done and what's next. It's not about slowing down — it's about not losing the thread."

#### 2. The Startup Founder
**Marcus, Non-technical founder with AI tools**

"I can build things now that would have required a dev team. But I kept building features nobody asked for because they were 'easy to add.' My product became confusing.

chkd forces me to write down what I'm building before I build it. That pause — just declaring the task — makes me ask 'do I actually need this?' Half the time the answer is no. The framework isn't friction, it's clarity."

#### 3. The Experienced Dev
**Raj, Senior Engineer using Claude Code**

"I don't need help coding. I need help not going down rabbit holes. When AI can do anything, the temptation is to do everything.

I use chkd to stay on track. Declare the task, build it, tick it, move on. The spec is my accountability partner. When I see my progress visualized, I ship faster because I'm not context-switching constantly."

## The Problem We Solve

### Without chkd (the default AI coding experience):

1. **AI runs ahead** — You ask for one thing, it builds three
2. **Context gets lost** — Close the session, lose the thread
3. **You become a spectator** — AI builds, you watch, you lose track
4. **Scope creeps invisibly** — "We can just add..." compounds
5. **No natural prioritization** — Every idea feels equally close

### With chkd:

1. **Declare before building** — Clarify what you want first
2. **Verify at each step** — Checkpoint, don't just watch
3. **Persistent spec** — Pick up where you left off
4. **Logged bugs** — Nothing forgotten, nothing derailed
5. **Intentional scope** — You choose what to build

---

## The Methodology

### The Cycle

```
DECLARE → BUILD → VERIFY → REPEAT
```

1. **Declare** — Clarify what you're building before you build it
2. **Build** — AI executes while you guide
3. **Verify** — Confirm it's right before moving on
4. **Repeat** — Next task

### The Hierarchy

```
Epic (big feature)
  └── Story (user-facing slice)
        └── Task (implementation step)
              └── Sub-task (atomic action)
```

Each level has a checkpoint. You verify before moving on.

### The Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `chkd working` | Declare what you're building |
| `chkd tick` | Mark it complete |
| `chkd bug` | Log an issue without derailing |
| `chkd pulse` | Quick status check-in |
| `chkd suggest` | Get recommendations |
| `chkd done` | Wrap up your session |

## Why It Matters

### The Meta-Rule (from research)

> Because build friction is gone, you must artificially re-introduce friction — but in thinking, not tooling.

chkd is that friction. Not in building — in deciding.

### The Value Props

1. **You're thinking, not watching**
   - The framework forces clarity before building
   - Better thinking in → better building out

2. **Nothing gets lost**
   - Spec persists across sessions
   - Bugs logged, progress tracked
   - Come back tomorrow, pick up where you left off

3. **Still fast**
   - Not heavyweight methodology
   - Six commands, one cycle
   - AI still does the heavy lifting

## How We Talk About This

### Do say:
- "A methodology for building with AI"
- "Keeps you thinking while AI builds"
- "Epic → Story → Task"
- "Nothing gets lost"
- "Declare before building"

### Don't say:
- "Control AI" (sounds restrictive)
- "Slow down" (sounds negative)
- "Discipline" (sounds punitive)
- "Prevent mistakes" (sounds fearful)
- "Best AI coding tool" (we're not a tool)

### The feeling we want:
- Calm
- Clear
- Opinionated
- Slightly restrictive (in a good way)
- Fast to understand
- Emotionally safe

## Key Quotes

From the research:

> "Speed no longer creates advantage. Restraint does."

> "If everything is easy to build, clarity becomes the only moat."

> "Complexity doesn't feel like complexity while you're building it. It only appears when someone tries to use it."

> "A great product solves one important problem in a way that feels inevitable once it exists."

---

## The One-Liner Test

If someone asks "What is chkd?", the answer should be:

**"A lightweight methodology that keeps you thinking while AI builds."**

If they want more:

**"It's a spec-based workflow — Epic, Story, Task — with six simple commands. You declare what you're building, AI builds it, you verify, repeat. Nothing gets lost between sessions."**

That's it. No selling. Just clarity.
