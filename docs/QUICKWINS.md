# Quick Wins

Small improvements to make when you have time.

- [x] Test quick win from CLI
- [ ] add to check list - what would this touch - how could I test
- [ ] add editing and allow full text to be seen in quick fix
- [ ] Add another step to to the checklist - documention and guides
- [ ] create a message of success when creating item - so users knows what the id was
- [ ] add ui for active bugfix mode, simalr to normal development mode with different colour and maybe something more interesting, big or small
