- [ ] add prompting to search the internet as well in the workflow research when approate
- [ ] add prompt persona's to the messages - increased experties focus - not generalit
- [ ] On pivot add prompt to document if addiotnal info will be helpful in the future
- [x] Workers communicate through Manager - user stays in one terminal, Manager relays questions/status from workers, user directs all work from single session
- [ ] Rename win() MCP tool to quickwin() for clarity
- [ ] Update BRAND.md with landing page research insights - "show don't tell", specific CTAs, real UI vs abstract art, Linear-style simplicity messaging
- [ ] Landing page font update - explore chunky block/ASCII art style like Claude Code terminal aesthetic
- [ ] Add spec_edit MCP tool - allow Claude to fill TBC fields when user provides clarification
- [ ] add delete story, epic access - faster clean up of spec.md if needed to the ui & mcp server commands
- [ ] add whats still open to the failed to close if not already sent?
- [ ] restyle debug and QW so that better handling overloaded and richer information enviroment.
- [ ] add timestamp to recency activly
- [ ] Auto-capture design changes during build - roll learnings back into epic/story docs so knowledge isn't lost
- [x] Beautify MCP tool names - remove redundant chkd_ prefix (chkd_tick → tick, chkd_working → working)
- [ ] Expand review service with interactive testing - click, scroll, form fill capabilities
- [x] Remove CLI references from CLAUDE.md - MCP is primary, review skills for potential move to workflow design on add
- [ ] Add audit-code-against-spec workflow - strong questions, area-aware checks (FE: use Chrome, BE: check database/logic), verify features match spec requirements
- [ ] Add chkd_quickwin start command - shows guidance, tracks session, reminds to clarify before coding
- [x] Quick win workflow should include commit+push after marking done - update chkd_won output
- [x] Bugfix workflow should include commit+push after each fix - add reminder to chkd_resolve output
- [x] Context-aware Polish phase - FE gets browser inspection prompts, BE gets scenario tracing prompts in Consider and Review steps
- [x] Add story type flag: --type refactor (explore/implement only)
- [x] Add story type flag: --type backend (skip UI/prototype phases)
- [x] Add story type flag: --type remove (skip prototype/feedback phases)

- [ ] make a handover function - setup consistancy of the handover, name convention, and filing consistany
- [ ] On status drop the next up often not helpful (comment out will improve later) add current state next to repo name so not cut off.
- [ ] can we catch an exit of the claude instance and signal our app
- [ ] handle also call - in idle
- [ ] Manager Claude answers Worker questions - intercept AskUserQuestion from workers, Manager can approve/answer or escalate to user

- [x] add numbered code on scussful stroy create reply
- [x] UI: Show success message with item ID after creating feature
- [x] Test quick win from CLI
- [x] add to check list - what would this touch - how could I test
- [x] add editing and allow full text to be seen in quick fix
- [x] Add another step to to the checklist - documention and guides
- [ ] create a message of success when creating item - so users knows what the id was
- [x] add ui for active bugfix mode, simalr to normal development mode with different colour and maybe something more interesting, big or small
