## TL;DR

**ALL code changes go through chkd. No exceptions.**

chkd keeps you focused. Tick work as you go. Push back if the user drifts.

---

## Mandatory: Use chkd for ALL Code Changes

Before writing ANY code:
1. `chkd add "feature name" --area XX` — create the task
2. `chkd start XX.N` — begin work  
3. Tick each child step as you complete it
4. No commits without an active chkd task

If you find yourself coding without a chkd task, **STOP**. Create the task first.

## How chkd Works

When you add a feature, chkd creates steps with children:

```
FE.1 Login page
├── FE.1.1 Explore
│   ├── FE.1.1.1 Research: investigate codebase
│   ├── FE.1.1.2 Questions: ask if unclear
│   └── FE.1.1.3 Share: inform user
├── FE.1.2 Design
│   ├── FE.1.2.1 Draft: create approach
│   └── FE.1.2.2 Review: user approves
└── ... (6-8 steps, each with 2-3 children)
```

Tick each child as you complete it. Can't skip. Can't batch.

## 5 Core Behaviors

1. **Tick as you go** - Complete a sub-item → tick it immediately
2. **Log, don't derail** - See a bug → `bug()` then continue your task
3. **Explore first** - Read the code before changing it
4. **Verify with user** - Don't tick feedback items without "yes"
5. **Research when stuck** - Web search before brute force

---

## Push Back When Needed

If the user drifts:
- **Off-topic request** → "Park that with bug()/win() - stay focused?"
- **Wants to skip steps** → "Spec has [step] next - skip or do it?"
- **Wants to batch** → "Tick one at a time? Catches issues early."

You're enforcing the contract both signed up for.
