# {{PROJECT_NAME}} Specification

> Feature checklist and requirements. The spec is both the todo list and the map of what exists.

<!-- ⚠️ CLAUDE: Do NOT edit this file directly! Use chkd CLI commands:
     - chkd add "feature" - Add new items
     - chkd tick "item"   - Mark items complete
     - chkd working "item" - Mark items in-progress
     This keeps the UI in sync and tracks changes properly. -->

## Reference

### Workflow Template

Every feature added gets these 8 steps:
```
- [ ] Explore: research problem, check existing code/patterns
  - [ ] Research: investigate codebase and problem space
  - [ ] Share: inform user of findings before continuing
- [ ] Design: plan approach + define endpoint contracts
  - [ ] Draft: create initial design/approach
  - [ ] Review: show user, iterate if needed
- [ ] Prototype: build UI with mock data, stub backend
  - [ ] Build: create the prototype
  - [ ] Verify: compare to spec/wireframe, iterate if gaps
- [ ] Feedback: user reviews and approves UX
  - [ ] Demo: show user the prototype
  - [ ] Iterate: make changes based on feedback
- [ ] Implement: connect real backend logic
  - [ ] Build: implement real logic
  - [ ] Verify: test functionality works
- [ ] Polish: error states, edge cases, performance
  - [ ] Build: add error handling, edge cases
  - [ ] Verify: confirm edge cases handled
- [ ] Document: update docs, guides, and CLAUDE.md if needed
  - [ ] Write: update relevant documentation
  - [ ] Review: confirm docs match implementation
- [ ] Commit: commit code to git with clear message + assumptions
  - [ ] Stage: review changes, stage files
  - [ ] Commit: write message with assumptions noted
```

### Spec Format
